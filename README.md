## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- View a final "product" as similar as possible to the original design, in my case I have had no access to the sketch or the Figma file, therefore spaces/sizes/... are "estimated"

## My process

### Built with

- StarterKit from Adalab (Bootcamp)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (variables, reset and mixins)
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My major learning with this project has been to "translate" design into grid

<h1>Some code I'm proud of:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Grid</li>
  <li>Variables</li>
  <li>Sass</li>
  <li>Mixins</li>
</ul>

### Continued development

I want to continue working on code optimization and acquire knowledge to add testing to my projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me to understand grid container/items properties . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
